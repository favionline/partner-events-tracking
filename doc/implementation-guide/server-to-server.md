# FAVI Partner Events Tracking

## Implementation guide - Server-to-server integration

### Integration types

There are three main ways how to integrate *FAVI Partner Events Tracking* into your e-shop:

1. [direct client-side (frontend) integration of FAVI script (called C2S)](client-direct.md),
2. [client-side (frontend) integration using Google Tag Manager (called GTM)](client-gtm.md),
3. server-to-server integration using API (called S2S).

The S2S solution is most feature rich, reliable and secure, but requires direct integration into your backend code, which is not feasible for everyone. So pick the integration which most suits your situation.

This guide is for the S2S integration, but you can have a look at the other ones using appropriate links.

### API

The server-to-server API is not yet publicly available, but it will be really soon.

If you prefer server-to-server integration (which we also prefer), please let us know and we will let you know as soon as you can start using it.

### Contact

If you have any questions regarding the implementation or need any help, please ask our account managers (you can find your contact in your partner dashboard after logging in on FAVI).
