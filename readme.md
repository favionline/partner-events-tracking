# FAVI Partner Events Tracking

This tracking code allows FAVI's partnering shops to participate in FAVI Extra and collect feedback from customers of their online shop.

### Integration types

There are three main ways how to integrate *FAVI Partner Events Tracking* into your e-shop:

1. [direct client-side (frontend) integration of FAVI script (called C2S)](doc/implementation-guide/client-direct.md),
2. [client-side (frontend) integration using Google Tag Manager (called GTM)](doc/implementation-guide/client-gtm.md),
3. [server-to-server integration using API (called S2S)](doc/implementation-guide/server-to-server.md).

The S2S solution is most feature rich, reliable and secure, but requires direct integration into your backend code, which is not feasible for everyone. So pick the integration which most suits your situation.

### Contact

If you have any questions regarding the implementation or need any help, please ask our account managers (you can find your contact in your partner dashboard after logging in on FAVI).
